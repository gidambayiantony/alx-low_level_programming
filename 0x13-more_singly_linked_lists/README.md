0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists
==================================

This repository contains C code snippets for working with more singly linked lists. The code snippets include functions to manipulate singly linked lists, such as adding nodes at the beginning and end of the list, deleting nodes at a given position, reversing the list, finding loops in the list, and more.

List of Functions
-----------------

- `print_listint`: Print elements of a singly linked list.
- `listint_len`: Calculate the number of elements in the list.
- `add_nodeint`: Add a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `add_nodeint_end`: Add a new node at the end of the list.
- `free_listint`: Free the entire linked list.
- `free_listint2`: Free the entire linked list and set the head to NULL.
- `pop_listint`: Delete the first element of the list.
- `get_nodeint_at_index`: Find a node at a given position in the list.
- `sum_listint`: Sum all the data in the list.
- `insert_nodeint_at_index`: Insert a new node at a given position in the list.
- `delete_nodeint_at_index`: Delete a node at a given position in the list.
- `reverse_listint`: Reverse the linked list.
- `print_listint_safe`: Print elements of the linked list safely, handling loops.
- `free_listint_safe`: Free the linked list safely, handling loops.
- `find_listint_loop`: Find the loop in the linked list, if any.

How to Use
----------

To use these functions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Include the necessary header file "lists.h" in your C file.

3. Compile your C file along with the provided code snippets.

Feel free to use these functions to manipulate singly linked lists in your C projects!
